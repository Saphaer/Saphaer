# Hi, I'm Saphaer 👋

My passion with computers began since i was a kid, at first it was gaming, then it was video editing, and around early 2024 i got into Linux. It all started with Fedora (GNOME), but then eventually i fell into Arch Linux rabbit hole, and i've been learning since then. What about coding? I was making some CLI tools in Python, some C# GUI projects, and recently i began to learn Rust, and honestly, im in love with it.
